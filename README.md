# Data Structures

## Stack

A data structure in which all insertions and deletions are mad at one end, called the top of the stack.

LIFO data structure: last in, first out.

### Common Stack Operations

```cmd
Push: push item to the top of the stack
Pop: remove and return the top item
Peek: return the top item without removing it
Is_empty: return true if the stack is empty
```
